### About

The **COSMOS Visualizer** web application provides an interface to
training data, model components, and results for the
[**COSMOS**](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos)
knowledge-base construction pipeline.
The [backend](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-result-visualizer) (
server, database, and
API) and
[UI components](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-visualizer-frontend)
are shared with our **Image Tagger** training-dataset
generation user interface.
The user interface components exposed here can be composed and reused
for other knowledge-base construction and introspection tasks.
